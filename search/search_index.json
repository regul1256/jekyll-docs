You'll find out what does \"acknowledge alarm\" mean and what shelved and monitored alarms are. Briefly about alarms # Alarms inform you of critical conditions and situations that require human attention or intervention. Alarms are usually associated with tags. When a tag or several tags register a critical condition, an associated alarm becomes active. There are also system alarms . Alarms section overview # The Alarms section allows users to monitor and manage alarms and displays their statistics. On the figure below, you can see one of the Alarms section's tabs: Figure 1. Alarms section view The section structure contains available to you alarms including those not active at the moment. In the content area you can see those of alarms that require your attention. The area consists of four tabs: All Shelved Acknowledged Monitored You can switch between them on the panel above. The view's table contains information such information as: Activation time Associated tag's name Information message (optional) State of the alarm Alarm priority Alarm category Some of the alarms may have an icon in the Name column. Clicking this icon redirects you to the History Replay mode of the page that is associated with the alarm. The replay of historical data starts one minute before the moment of alarm occurrence and ends at the current moment. Also, in the last column, you can choose one of the available operations: Acknowledge Shelve and Unshelve Start Monitoring Manage Comment The HMI View signals about alarm activation in several ways: Colour. The red colour shows that the alarm is active. If there is at least one active alarm, the counter in the interface header becomes red and indicates the total number of unacknowledged alarms. Also, the animated badge appears on the section icon on the left. This badge is red if there exists at least one active alarm. Similarly to the counter, the badge indicates unacknowledged alarms. Acknowledge alarm # The action acknowledge means that the user confirmed alarm notification. Let's look at what happens when you acknowledge the alarm: If the alarm condition still remains, then notification stays visible in the table. The following scenario occurs: The alarm changes its colour to pink The number of alarms in the interface header's counter decreases by one. The same thing happens with the badge on the section\u2019s icon The alarm appears in the Acknowledged tab As soon as the alarm condition is no longer active, the alarm disappears from the table tabs All and Acknowledged .

The snapshotHistory function # snapshotHistory(pathToTag, time) If the time argument is unspecified, the function returns an average value for the period from the report's beginning to ending time. If opposite, the function returns the tag value for the specified moment. The time argument can be one of the following functions: getStartDate() getStartDate() getTimeBefore() Also, this argument can be a timestamp of the following format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\". The parameter pathToTag defines the tag address in the project. In general, the path has the following view: \"project_id/Signals/Folder1/../Tag_name\" The following examples of the snapshotHistory() function show different use cases. History value for a specific point in time: snapshotHistory(\"063441c03f1211e994560242ac14000c/Signals/CM-Core1/GT11/3020_VS11_GT11_SP\", '2019-10-14 11:15') History value for the beginning time of the report: snapshotHistory(\"063441c03f1211e994560242ac14000c/Signals/CM-Core1/GT11/3020_VS11_GT11_SP\", getStartDate()) History value for the report's period: snapshotHistory(\"063441c03f1211e994560242ac14000c/Signals/CM-Core1/GT11/3020_VS11_GT11_SP\") Other Reports expressions # getStartDate() This function returns the UNIX timestamp of the beginning time of the report. getEndDate() This function returns the UNIX timestamp of the ending time of the report. Important ControlMachines\u2122 counts UNIX time in milliseconds. toFixed(value, digits) This function rounds a decimal value to a specified number of digits. The first argument may be either a static value or a function's result. The second argument is the number of decimal places to be left. The number of decimal places lays between 0 and 20. If the second argument is omitted, then the function rounds the value to ones. Here is a usage example of this function: toFixed(snapshotHistory(\"063441c03f1211e994560242ac14000c/Signals/CM-Core1/GT11/3020_VS11_GT11_SP\"), 2) The example shows that the toFixed function rounds the result of the snapshotHistory function to the nearest hundredth. getTimeBefore(unit, time?) This function returns the UNIX timestamp of a specified moment in the past. The argument unit defines the retrospective period. Available units of time: s - second m - minute h - hour d - day w - week mo - month y - year And the time parameter is a point in time from which the period takes count. If this argument is undefined, then the count takes place from the current moment. The following example shows the use of this function: getTimeBefore('3d', '2019-10-14 17:53:00') The result of this function would be this timestamp: 1570798380000 , which stands for 2019-10-11 12:53 (UTC).

Alarm properties # Alarm properties located in a special menu that allows to set main parameters of alarm itself and conditions of its occurrence. The following table describes main settings of alarms. Table 1. Alarm main settings Property Required/Optional Description Title Required Set the alarm name for HMI View users to see on their screens. Priority Required Set one of three levels of alarm importance: low, medium, high. Category Optional Set the alarm group. It either can be one of default or a custom category. Message Optional Type a text message for HMI View that users will read when the alarm occurs. HMI Link Optional Link the alarm to a page. There appears the button that navigates HMI View users to the associated page. Realarm timeout Optional Set a timer to reactivate the alarm. The alarm will be active after a certain period if conditions have not changed after the acknowledgement. Enable Required Turn the alarm on and off. Configure different conditions of alarm activation. The Condition settings block contains settings that allow you to associate the alarm with the tag and define required for alarm activation circumstances. See Condition settings content in the table below. Table 2. Condition settings Property Required Description Source Tag Required Associate the alarm with the tag. Condition type Required Choose one of four options: Value Control Discrete Deviation Rate Of Change Complex condition (a combination of several conditions) Delay-on Optional Set the delay for alarm activation. Delay-off Optional Set the delay for alarm deactivation. The Condition type option defines arrangements of alarm activation. Choose Value Control , if the numerical tag value needs monitoring. There are four mathematical operators to describe circumstances of alarm activation. The source tag can be compared with another tag or a constant value.

Set Determine particular tag values that user can write to the tag. Important The Limits setting limits only the values that users can write to the tag. The tag can take values that have not been set by Limits if it, for example, depends on some external factors. Format string Set the format of displaying the value in the HMI View. It is relevant for tags of float types. You can define the number of digits after a decimal point. For example, you need two figures to be displayed after a point.

Important For boolean types of data the only available option is No data transformation Linear numeric transformation transforms the value from one scale into another. Multiply numeric transformation multiplies the value with a custom coefficient. Put the number you need in the Factor field. You can type integer and fractional values. When active, the Do not remove on tag importing flag prevents the tag from deleting while importing tags. The Do not require commenting on value change option allows users to change the tag's value without leaving records in the commentary field. Other settings include: Limits Configure one of three possible options: None The system defines operable limits itself. Range Define the range of values that available to a user for operations. Set Determine particular tag values that user can write to the tag. Important The Limits setting limits only the values that users can write to the tag. The tag can take values that have not been set by Limits if it, for example, depends on some external factors. Format string Set the format of displaying the value in the HMI View.
